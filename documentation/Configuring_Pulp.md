# <a name="Intro"/> Intro

We use [Pulp](https://pulpproject.org/) for repository management: caching and versioning of _artifacts_ like _RPMs_
to make sure we can install a specific version of packages and hence recreate a machine in a specific state.

Pulp can manage different types of _artifacts/repos_ using plug-ins. E.g. for _RPMs_, _Ansible roles_, _Python Packages_, etc.
So far we use Pulp only for _RPMs_, so we need (the documentation for) the _**Pulp core framework**_ and the _**Pulp RPM plug-in**_.


### Pulp Concepts:

 ![](./media/pulp.svg)

Pulp uses the following concepts:

1. _**Repository**_:
   A collection of _artifacts_.
2. _**Remote**_:
   A repository can be synced with an upstream _remote_
3. _**Repository Version**_:
   A new immutable version is created ach time a _repo_ gets modified.
   (E.g. add content / delete content / sync with a _remote_)
4. _**Publication**_:
   A _publication_ is a _repository version_ + metadata required by clients
   in order to be able to consume the content from that _repo version_.
   E.g. manifest files, indices, etc.
5. _**Distribution**_:
   Is a location/URL where a _publication_ is served to clients usually over HTTP(S).

### Pulp Components

A Pulp server consists of 3 components:

 * REST API (a Django application running under a WSGI server)
 * Content serving application (An aiohttp.server based application)
 * Tasking system ([Redis Queue](https://python-rq.org/), which provides a _resource manager_ and _workers_)

### Users and authentication

Three different users are required for a complete Pulp installation.

1. _**repo\_management\_user**_
   This is a Linux user/account.
   Users in the Linux admin group can sudo to this user to manage Pulp manually.
   E.g. create/update/delete artifacts, repositories, remotes, publications and distributions.
2. _**pulp\_api\_user**_
   This is the account used by the *repo_management_user* to login to the Pulp API to work with Pulp.
   The pulp_api_password is for this account.
3. _**pulp\_user**_:
   This is a Linux user/account, which is used to run the Pulp daemons/services.
   This is configured in the pulp.pulp_installer.pulp_all_services role our pulp_server role depends on.
   The default *pulp_user* is _**pulp**_

The pulp_api_user and pulp_api_password are only used to secure the API.

 * The *pulp_api_user* must be _**admin**_ in Pulp 3.
 * The *pulp_api_password* will be configured by the pulp-installer upon initial configuration with an Ansible playbook.
   The pulp-intaller will **not** update a password though. Use the ```pulpcore-manager``` command to change the admin password:
   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/pulpcore-manager reset-admin-password -p [password]
   ```

In theory you can require clients that want to fetch artifacts (like RPMs) from a Pulp server to authenticate to Pulp,
but we don't require clients to authenticate.

The *pulp_secret* is used by the Django app too; for "Any usage of cryptographic signing, unless a different key is provided."

### For admins: API only

Pulp started as API only. There is a command line interface (CLI) in beta, but there is no GUI.
Other projects like Katello provide GUIs for Pulp. We don't use any GUI on top of Pulp to keep deployment as simple as possible;
it has enough dependencies already.

### Pulp uses storage efficiently

 * Multiple _distributions_ and _publications_ and _repository versions_ may have the same version of an _artifact_,
   which is stored only once.
 * You can save on storage by using `policy='on_demand'` for remotes.
   This means that Pulp will only fetch the meta-data for artifacts when a repository is synchronized with that remote.
   The artifacts themselves will only get fetched from the remote when a client requests them.

### Additional tooling

 * [Pulp CLI](https://github.com/pulp/pulp-cli): Pulp command line interface.
 * [Pulp Installer](https://github.com/pulp/pulp_installer): Ansible roles to install or upgrade a Pulp 3 server.
 * [Pulp Squeezer](https://github.com/pulp/squeezer): Ansible collection to manage repos on a Pulp 3 server.

### Documentation

 * Pulp core docs https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/index.html
 * Pulp RPM docs  https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_rpm/index.html
 * Pulp core API  https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulpcore/restapi.html
 * Pulp RPM API   https://docs.pulpproject.org/pulp_rpm/restapi.html
 * Pulp RPM API example scripts: https://github.com/pulp/pulp_rpm/tree/master/docs/_scripts
 * Pulp Installer docs https://pulp-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/
 * Pulp Squeezer docs are not online (yet). You will need to look at the code
   either in GitHub: https://github.com/pulp/squeezer
   or once you have this Ansible collection installed from the commandline using: `ansible-doc pulp.squeezer.<module_name>`

# <a name="Create-Server"/> Create Server

### Use deploy-os_server.yml playbook

The `deploy-os_server.yml` playbook can be used to create all VMs for a cluster including a repo server.
This playbook requires the _OpenStack SDK_ to be installed and configured on your _Ansible control host_;
See the `README.md` in the root of this repo for details.

# <a name="Install-And-Configure-With-Ansible"/> Install and configure with Ansible

### Using the pulp_server role

Make sure the requirements/dependencies from Ansible Galaxy were installed.
The exec summary:
```bash
ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml
```
See the `README.md` in the root of this repo for details.
Next you can use
```bash
. ./lor-init
lor-config [stack_prefix]
ansible-playbook -u [admin_account] single_role_playbooks/pulp_server.yml
```
This will install Pulp, create an admin account to manage Pulp and install the Pulp CLI in a Python virtual environment
for that admin account. It will also do part of the initial configuration, but this is incomplete due to missing features in _Pulp Squeezer_;
the *pulp_server* role can create _remotes_ and _repositories_, but it cannot associate a _remote_ with a _repository_ yet.
Furthermore the role cannot know when you want to sync a _repo_ with a _remote_ to update content.

### Manual work following the pulp_server role

The following steps must be performed manually for now:

 * Upload custom RPMs to the Pulp server.
 * Manual work on the Pulp server:
   * Add content (RPMs) to a _repository_ for the ones without _remote_.
   * Add a _remote_ to a _repository_.
   * Sync a _repository_ with a _remote_.
   * Create a new _publication_ for a _repository version_.
   * Create a new _distribution_ for a _publication_.
   * Update the _publication_ for an existing _distribution_.

#### Manual work - Upload custom RPMs to Pulp server.

```bash
#
# This assumes you have the custom RPMs in a local folder named umcg suffixed with a dash and the ansible {{ os_distribution }} variable.
# E.g. "umcg-centos7" or "umcg-rocky9".
# If you use a different local folder with custom RPMs make sure the path to the custom RPMs on the repo server is
#     /admin/repoadmin/{{ os_distribution }}/*.rpm
#
rsync -av --rsync-path 'sudo -u repoadmin rsync' [os_distribution] [admin]@[jumphost]+[stack_prefix]-repo:/admin/repoadmin/
```

#### Manual work - on the Pulp server

The remaining tasks can be performed on the Pulp server in one go with the idempotent function named ```pulp-sync-publish-distribute```,
which was deployed by the ```pulp_server``` role:

```bash
ssh [admin]@[jumphost]+[stack_prefix]-repo
sudo -u repoadmin bash
cd
source ./pulp-cli.venv/bin/activate
set -u
pulp status
source ./pulp-init.bash
pulp-sync-publish-distribute
```

Alternatively or for debugging issues with ```pulp-sync-publish-distribute``` you can also perform these tasks manually using:

 * Either Pulp CLI commands where possible (easier and recommended).
 * Or by sending raw HTTP GET/PUT calls to the Pulp API using a commandline HTTP client like HTTPie or cURL (harder).

Below are code examples for CentOS 7 machines and corresponding repos.
Note that other distros like Rocky 9 use a different list of repos.

##### Manual work - on the Pulp server - Login and become repoadmin user on repo server.

```bash
ssh [admin]@[jumphost]+[stack_prefix]-repo
sudo -u repoadmin bash
cd
source pulp-cli.venv/bin/activate
set -u
pulp status
```

##### Manual work - on the Pulp server - Add custom content (RPMs) to a the custom repo without remote.

```bash
#
# Upload RPM files to create Pulp RPMs and add them to
# our Custom Packages for Enterprise Linux (cpel) repo.
#
for rpm in $(find umcg-* -name '*.rpm'); do
    #
    # Get package name from RPM file name.
    # This is a bit risky regex matching,
    # but we can only use the package name and cannot use the file name
    # to check if it was already uploaded to Pulp.
    #
    package_name="$(basename "${rpm%%-[vr0-9][0-9.-]*}")"
    #
    # Check if the package was already uploaded to Pulp.
    #
    rpm_location_href=$(pulp --format json rpm content list \
                             --name "${package_name}" \
                        | jq -r '.[0].location_href')
    if [[ "${rpm_location_href:-}" == "$(basename "${rpm}")" ]]; then
        echo "INFO: ${rpm} already uploaded to Pulp."
        rpm_pulp_href=$(pulp --format json rpm content list \
                                 --name "${package_name}" \
                            | jq -r '.[0].pulp_href')
        echo "INFO: Get sha256 checksum for ${rpm} already uploaded to Pulp."
        rpm_sha256=$(pulp --format json rpm content list \
                                 --name "${package_name}" \
                     | jq -r '.[0].sha256')
        if [[ "${rpm_sha256:-}" != "$(sha256sum "${rpm}")" ]]; then
            echo "ERROR: sha256 checksum for ${rpm} on disk does match with the checksum for the previously uploaded RPM."
            echo 'ERROR: This code will not replace an RPM with a newer one.'
            echo 'ERROR: If you really need to replace the existing RPM, you must delete the old one manually first.'
            break
        fi
    else
        #
        # Upload the RPM to create an artifact
        #
        echo "INFO: Uploading ${rpm} to Pulp ..."
        rpm_pulp_href=$(pulp --format json rpm content upload \
                             --file "${rpm}" \
                             --relative-path "$(basename "${rpm}")" \
                        | jq -r '.pulp_href')
    fi
    if [[ -n "${rpm_pulp_href:-}" ]]; then
        #
        # Add RPM to cpel repo.
        #
        echo "INFO: Adding ${rpm} with pulp_href ${rpm_pulp_href:-} to cpel repo ..."
        pulp rpm repository content add \
            --repository cpel7 \
            --package-href "${rpm_pulp_href}"
    else
        echo "ERROR: failed to get pulp_href for RPM, Cannot add ${rpm} to cpel7 repo."
        break
    fi
done
```

##### Manual work - on the Pulp server - Declare repo list

```bash
declare -a pulp_repos_with_remotes
declare -a all_pulp_repos
pulp_repos_with_remotes=(
    centos7-base
    centos7-updates
    centos7-extras

    e2fsprogs7
    ltb7
    rsyslog7
)
all_pulp_repos=(
    "${pulp_repos_with_remotes[@]}"
    cpel7
)
```

##### Manual work - on the Pulp server - Add remotes to repos.

```bash
#
# Make sure you already declared the ${pulp_repos_with_remotes[@]} array: see above.
#
for repo in "${pulp_repos_with_remotes[@]}"; do
    pulp rpm repository update --name ${repo} --remote ${repo}-remote
done
```

##### Manual work - on the Pulp server - Sync repos with remotes.

```bash
#
# Make sure you already declared the ${pulp_repos_with_remotes[@]} array: see above.
#
for repo in "${pulp_repos_with_remotes[@]}"; do
    pulp rpm repository sync --name ${repo}
done
```

##### Manual work - on the Pulp server - Create/update distributions based on new publications based on new repository versions.

```bash
set -e
set -u

stack_prefix='' # Must be filled in; check group_vars (f.e. 'fd').
stack_name=''   # Must be filled in; check group_vars (f.e. 'fender_cluster').

#
for repo in "${all_pulp_repos[@]}"; do
    echo "INFO: Processing distribution name ${stack_prefix}-${repo} with base path ${stack_name%_cluster}/${repo} ..."
    #
    # Get latest repository version href for this repo.
    #
    latest_version_href=$(pulp --format json rpm repository show --name "${repo}" | jq -r '.latest_version_href')
    #
    # Check if we already have a publication for the latest repository version.
    #
    if [[ $(pulp --format json rpm publication list --repository-version "${latest_version_href}" 2>/dev/null \
          | jq -r 'first.pulp_href') =~ /pulp/api/ ]]; then
        echo "INFO:     Using existing publication for latest version of ${repo} repository ..."
        publication_href=$(pulp --format json \
            rpm publication list --repository-version "${latest_version_href}" \
          | jq -r 'first.pulp_href')
    else

# <a name="Maintenance"/> Various manual Pulp maintenance tasks.

### Expired web server certificates

The ```pulp_server``` _role_ will not automatically update web server certificates when they expire.
When the certificate expires you must:

 * Delete the expired cert manually on the Pulp server:
   ```
   rm -f /etc/pulp/certs/pulp_webserver.crt
   rm -f /etc/pulp/certs/pulp_webserver.key
   ```
 * Re-run the  ```pulp_server``` Ansible _role_ to create a new certificate.

Note that when the root cert also expired, then you will need to delete that one too and
 * Add the new root cert to the league-of-robots repo at ```files/[stack_name]/[stack_prefix]-repo_pulp_root.crt``` and create a PR.
 * Re-run the  ```pulp_client``` Ansible _role_ to distribute the new root certificate to the clients.

### Cleanup artifacts to remove RPMs no longer used by any repo version / publication.

To remove RPMs no longer used and reclaim disk space

```bash
ssh [admin]@[jumphost]+[stack_prefix]-repo
sudo -u repoadmin bash
cd
source pulp-cli.venv/bin/activate
pulp orphans delete
```

### When the Pulp server fails to start

Check if the RPMs added to our ```cpel``` repos have the required checksums.
Sometimes the artifacts somehow only received MD5 checksums.
The default ```ALLOWED_CONTENT_CHECKSUMS = ["sha224", "sha256", "sha384", "sha512"]```
Pulp also supports ```md5``` and ```sha1```, but those are not by default "allowed" anymore.
This may result in the error:
```
django.core.exceptions.ImproperlyConfigured: There have been identified artifacts with forbidden checksum 'md5'.
Run 'pulpcore-manager handle-artifact-checksums' first to unset forbidden checksums.
```

To get a report on the problematic ones:
```
root@[stack_prefix]-repo $> /usr/local/bin/pulpcore-manager handle-artifact-checksums --report
```

To calculate new "allowed" checksums for the problematic ones:
```
root@[stack_prefix]-repo $> /usr/local/bin/pulpcore-manager handle-artifact-checksums
```

ToDo: we need to figure out how to create the correct type of checksums when adding RPMs to our custom ```cpel``` repo.

### Adding rpm to repo repository

The commands are listed below, but in general, these are the steps to add an rpm to the pulp repository:

1. upload rpm to repo server, connect to server and load pulp environment
2. upload artifact to the pulp
3. create rpm from this new artifact
4. add the rpm to the correct repository
5. create publication
6. update distribution with new publication
7. client side check

#### 1. upload rpm to repo server, connect to server and load pulp environment
```
$ rsync -av --rsync-path 'sudo -u repoadmin rsync' ega-fuse-client-2.1.0-1.noarch.rpm sandi@corridor+fd-repo:/admin/repoadmin/umcg-centos7/
$ ssh sandi@corridor+fd-repo
$ sudo su - repoadmin
$ source pulp-cli.venv/bin/activate
```

#### 2. upload artifact to the pulp
```
pulp artifact upload --file umcg-centos7/ega-fuse-client-2.1.0-1.noarch.rpm
export BASE_ADDR='http://localhost:24817'

wait_until_task_finished() {
    echo "Polling the task until it has reached a final state."
    local task_url=$1
    while true
    do
        response=$(http "$task_url")
        local response
        state=$(jq -r .state <<< "${response}")
        local state
        jq . <<< "${response}"
        case ${state} in
            failed|canceled)
                echo "Task in final state: ${state}"
                exit 1
                ;;
            completed)
                echo "$task_url complete."
                break
                ;;
            *)
                echo "Still waiting..."
                sleep 1
                ;;
        esac
    done
}
```

Collect the returned **pulp_href** variable and create an array with the correct values

#### 3. create rpm from this new artifact

```
declare -A custom_rpms=(
    ['ega-fuse-client-2.1.0-1.noarch.rpm']='/pulp/api/v3/artifacts/cc7f9dd2-c086-45b4-97fd-362e34b0baff/'
)
```

execute the following for pulp to create an rpm out of the uploaded artifact:

```
for custom_rpm in "${!custom_rpms[@]}"; do
    # Create RPM package from an artifact
    echo "Create RPM ${custom_rpm} from artifact ${custom_rpms[${custom_rpm}]}."
    TASK_URL=$(http POST "$BASE_ADDR"/pulp/api/v3/content/rpm/packages/ \
        artifact="${custom_rpms[${custom_rpm}]}" relative_path="${custom_rpm}" | jq -r '.task')
    # Poll the task (here we use a function defined in docs/_scripts/base.sh)
    wait_until_task_finished "$BASE_ADDR""$TASK_URL"
    # After the task is complete, it gives us a new package (RPM content)
    echo "Set PACKAGE_HREF from finished task."
    PACKAGE_HREF=$(http "$BASE_ADDR""$TASK_URL"| jq -r '.created_resources | first')
    echo "Inspecting Package."
    http "$BASE_ADDR""$PACKAGE_HREF"
done
```

collect the returned **pulp_href** and feed it again in the array

```
declare -A custom_rpms=(
    ['ega-fuse-client-2.1.0-1.noarch.rpm']='/pulp/api/v3/content/rpm/packages/362e30bfff-efg7-dbc3-cc23-345feea/'
)
```

#### 4. add the rpm to the correct repository

Now you need to select the **pulp_href** of the correct repository that you want to add to the rpm package

```
pulp rpm repository list                # and get the pul_href of correct repository (usually cpel)
REPO_HREF='/pulp/api/v3/repositories/rpm/rpm/4baaad23-0a10-4a7e-90fe-17dea19b84f3/'           # < this is an example
```

Then execute

```
for custom_rpm in "${!custom_rpms[@]}"; do
    # Add created RPM content to repository
    echo "Add created RPM Package ${custom_rpm} to repository."
    TASK_URL=$(http POST "$BASE_ADDR""$REPO_HREF"'modify/' \
        add_content_units:="[\"${custom_rpms[${custom_rpm}]}\"]" | jq -r '.task')
    # Poll the task (here we use a function defined in docs/_scripts/base.sh)
    wait_until_task_finished "$BASE_ADDR""$TASK_URL"
done
```

and check if repository has incremented version

```
pulp rpm repository version list --repository cpel7
```


#### 5. create publication

First check which publication is currently used by distribution, so you can later compare

```
pulp rpm distribution show --href /pulp/api/v3/distributions/rpm/rpm/8fb72c53-8832-430c-83af-656310be4c2d/
```

then create publication

```
pulp rpm publication create --repository /pulp/api/v3/repositories/rpm/rpm/b7180e7b-ca73-4357-a89c-2f813e4dab1c/versions/1/     --version ?
```


#### 6. update distribution with new publication

```
pulp rpm distribution update --name ? --publication /pulp/api/v3/publications/rpm/rpm/98300791-39cb-4918-b613-7c8f481a8ffd/
```

With correct distribution name, like **nb-cpel7** or **fd-cpel7**. Then check if distribution is now linked to the new publication (f.e. for fd--cpel7 repository on fender)

```
pulp rpm distribution show --name fd-cpel7
```


#### 7. client side check

Sometimes when you check the client side, the package is not yet visible, therefore you might need to clear cache:

```
# yum clean all
# yum search --showduplicates ega-fuse
```
