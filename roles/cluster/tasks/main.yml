      # --omit-dir-times  Is required to prevent "sync error: some files/attrs were not transferred"
      #                   for file systems like NFS mounts that cannot handle setting dir times properly.
      # --omit-link-times Is required to prevent "sync error: some files/attrs were not transferred"
      #                   for file systems like NFS mounts that cannot handle setting dir times properly.
      #                   Requires rsync >= 3.1.2 (default on Enterprise Linux >= 7.x).
      # --chmod           Is required to prevent errors when the perms on the source are not what is required/expected on the destination.
      #                   Fixing perms on the source would be good, but that may be out of our control.
      #                   In that case --chmod ensures we get what we want on the destination.
      #                   Works only when combined with --perms.
      # --force           Is required when symlinks have changed into dirs/files or vice versa.
      #                   In that case the wrong outdated stuff has to be deleted on the destination first before the new stuff can be created.
      #                   Deleting the outdated stuff may fail without --force.
      # --relative        In combination with a "source_server:some/path/not/created/on/destination/./path/created/on/destination/some_file" (dot dir)
      #                   recreates a partial dir structure on the destination relative to the /./ dir, when it does not already exist.
      #                   Without this combination of --relative and dot dir rsync will error when the path does not exist on the destination.
      #                   IMPORTANT: src and dest paths must be absolute paths. Otherwise Ansible will expand the path itself which will remove the /./ dir.
