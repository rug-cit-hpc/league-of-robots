        # =================================

        # Disable built-in directory listings.
        DirectoryIndex disabled

        # Restrict access to authenticated users.
        AuthType Basic

        # Use the 'irods' HTTP basic authentication provider, implemented by
        # davrods. This provider is used for setting up the iRODS connection,
        # and is therefore required for davrods to function.
        AuthBasicProvider irods

        # The DAV provider for this location.
        #
        # davrods implements multiple dav providers, use either:
        # - davrods-nolocks:                 WebDAV class 1 provider, no support for locking
        # - davrods-locallock (recommended): WebDAV class 2 provider, uses a DBM lock database local to this webserver
        #
        # Note that the davrods-locallock provider requires an apache-writable lockdb directory
        # (/var/lib/davrods, or a path specified using the DavRodsLockDB directive - see further down this file).
        # The RPM distribution creates this directory for you.

        # a temporary file is created during upload and upon succesful transfer this
        # temporary file is renamed to the destination filename.
        # NB: Please note that the use of temporary files may conflict with your iRODS
        # data policies (e.g. a acPostProcForPut would act upon the temporary filename).

    # To avoid cleartext password communication we strongly recommend to
    # enable davrods only over SSL.
    # For HTTPS-only access, change the port at the start of the vhost block
    # from 80 to 443 and add your SSL options below.
