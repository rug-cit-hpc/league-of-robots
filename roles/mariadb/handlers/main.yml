# Important: maintain correct handler order.
# Handlers are executed in the order in which they are defined 
# and not in the order in which they are listed in a "notify: handler_name" statement!
#
# Restart before reload: an reload after a restart may be redundant but should not fail,
# but the other way around may fail when the impact of changes was too large for a reload.
#
# Currently restart only: mysql.service does not support reloads yet :(.
