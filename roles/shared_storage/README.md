# Ansible Role: shared_storage

This role mounts parts of shared storage systems (shares a.k.a. exports) on various machines of an HPC cluster depending on their purpose.

## Terminology

 * **PFS**: **P**hysical **F**ile **S**ystem. Could also be actually virtualised nowadays, but always something only sys admins should worry about.
   We never bother end users on an HPC cluster with _PFS-ses_.
 * **LFS**: **L**ogical **F**ile **S**ystem. A piece of a (shared/local) storage system for a specific purpose and a specific group of users.
   This is how end users see and work with storage systems: _PFS_ naming is consistent and remains constant no matter on which _PFS_ the _LFS_ is located. 
   When a _PFS_ is End of Life and phased out, the data can be migrated to a different _PFS_ keeping the _LFS_ and hence the path to the data for end users exactly the same.
 * **home**: An _LFS_ for user's home directories.
 * **tmp[0-9]{2}**: An _LFS_ for **t**e**mp**orary data.
   * On a file system optimized for High Performance (HP) where possible.
   * Without backups.
   * with automagic cleanup of old data.
   * By design mounted on both _User Interface (UI)_ and _compute nodes_ of an HPC cluster.
 * **prm[0-9]{2}**: An _LFS_ for **p**e**rm**anent data:
   * On a file system optimized for High Availability (HA) where possible.
   * With backups.
   * Without automagic cleanup of old data.
   * By design only mounted on the _User Interface (UI)_ servers of an HPC cluster.
     In order to crunch data from a _prm_ _LFS_ it must be staged to a _tmp_ _LFS_ first.
 * **apps**: An _LFS_ for the original of the shared environment (software, modules, reference data).
   * By design mounted read-write and only on the _Deploy Admin Interface (DAI)_ in **/apps**.
   * Preferably on a local file system and not on shared storage as the latter is known to be horribly slow 
     for many ```module load/unload``` commands, which are used during dependency management, and for building software from sources.
 * **env[0-9]{2}**: An _LFS_ for a copy of the shared environment (software, modules, reference data).
   * By design mounted read-only on both _User Interface (UI)_ and _compute nodes_ of an HPC cluster in **/apps**
   * By design mounted read-write on the _Deploy Admin Interface (DAI)_ of an HPC cluster in **/mnt/env[0-9]{2}**
     The _DAI_ also contains the read-write primary copy / original of the shared environment from a local storage device and mounted in **/apps**
     An rsync-based tool is used to synchronise **/apps** to all copies in **/mnt/env[0-9]{2}**,
     which is read-only mounted in **/apps** on the _UI_ and _compute nodes_.

An HPC cluster can have
 * Only one **home** and one **apps** _LFS_
 * Multiple **tmp[0-9]**, **prm[0-9]** and **env[0-9]** _LFS-ses_. We keep the numbers unique over all clusters.
   Hence there is only one _prm03_. If multiple machines optionally from multiple clusters have an _prm03_ _LFS_ mount,
   it must contain the same data with the same permissions.

## group_vars

The _LFS-ses_ and _PFS-ses_ they are located on must be specified for each HPC cluster in the corresponding _group\_vars_ located at ```groups_vars/${name}-cluster/vars.yml```
An example snippet (see below for explanation of what get's mounted where based on this example):

#### pfs_mounts

The **pfs_mounts** variable lists all Physical File Systems and their technical specs required by the ```mount``` command. Per _PFS_:

 * **pfs**: a label for this _PFS_.
   * Preferably only lowercase characters a-z.
   * Used as the mountpoint in **/mnt/** on the _Sys Admin Interface (SAI)_.
   * Usually the same as a (sub)folder from the file system.
     Can be either the root folder if the entire file system is used only as this _PFS_ 
     or a subfolder when the same storage system is used by other systems / clients too.
   * Optionally the label may be suffixed by a slash forward and the subfolder.
     This can be used when the parent dir of the subfolder contains other subfolders 
     with data from other other systems / clients
     that should **not** be mounted / available on the _SAI_.
 * **source**: device or URL for the file system as used by the ```mount``` command.
   Will always get suffixed with the ***pfs** value.
 * **type**: file system type as used by the ```mount``` command.
 * **rw_options**: mount options when mounting this _PFS_ **read-write** using the ```mount``` command.
 * **ro_options**: mount options when mounting this _PFS_ **read-only** using the ```mount``` command.

The example above would result in the following _PFS_ entries in ```/etc/fstab``` only on the _SAI_:
```
some-storage001.stor.local:/ifs/isilon11     /mnt/isilon11    nfs4      defaults,_netdev,vers=4.0,noatime,nodiratime    0 0
10.0.0.203@tcp12:10.0.0.204@tcp12:/lusty2    /mnt/lusty2      lustre    defaults,lazystatfs,flock                       0 0
```

#### lfs_mounts

The **lfs_mounts** variable lists all Logical File Systems, which provide the user's perspective of the data. Per _LFS_:

 * **lfs**: a label for this _LFS_
   * **env[0-9]{2}** _LFS-ses_:
      * Label is used as the mountpoint in **/mnt/** on the _Deploy Admin Interface (DAI)_.
      * On all other machines the mountpoint is always **/apps**.
   * **home** _LFS-ses_:
      * Mountpoint is always **/home**.
      
   * **tmp[0-9]{2}** and **prm[0-9]{2}** _LFS-ses_:
      * Mountpoint per groups is always **/groups/${group}/${lfs}**.
 * **pfs**: a label for the _PFS_ that holds this _LFS_.
   * Used to lookup the technical specs required by the ```mount``` command in the ```pfs_mounts``` variable.
   * Hence for every label mentioned here there must be an entry in the list of ```pfs_mounts```.
 * **machines**: Only for **env[0-9]{2}** and **home** _LFS-ses_.
   * Lists the machines that should use this _LFS_
   * A cluster may use multiple _LFS-ses_ of the same type for different machines to distribute the IO load.
   * A specific machine can only mount one instance of the same _LFS_ type and 
     hence should not be listed for multiple **env[0-9]{2}** _LFS-ses_ nor for multiple **home** _LFS-ses_.
 * **groups**: Only for **tmp[0-9]{2}** and **prm[0-9]{2}** _LFS-ses_.
   * Lists the groups that can use this _LFS_.
   * Subfolders with correct permissions will be created automagically for the specified groups.
   * Groups may have access to multiple **tmp[0-9]{2}** or **prm[0-9]{2}** _LFS-ses_.
 
The example above would result in the following _LFS_ entries in ```/etc/fstab```:
 * on the _SAI_:
   ```
   some-storage001.stor.local:/ifs/cluster/isilon11/home    /home nfs4 defaults,_netdev,vers=4.0,noatime,nodiratime 0 0
   ```
 * on the _DAI_:
