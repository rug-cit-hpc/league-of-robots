# Generate a public/private key pair with MobaXterm on Windows

Your OS comes with a default terminal and key generator application (OpenSSH), but you can also download and install another one (we offer partial support for MobaXterm).

Before you decide which client you wish to use, note that different client programs support different public/private keypairs formats - *formats are noninterchangeable between clients*, without conversion.

There are two options to login to clusters from Windows

 1. Either by using [MobaXterm client](#1-mobaxterm-option) software which requires installation
 2. Or simply use Windows built-in [OpenSSH](#2-using-windows-openssh) software

## 1. MobaXterm option

### 1.1 Get MobaXterm - a terminal and key generator application

There are many options all of which have their own pros and cons; we suggest you give [MobaXterm](https://mobaxterm.mobatek.net) version >= 12.3 a try 
as it features a key generator, terminal and graphical user interface for data transfers all-in-one.
The following steps use the *portable* version of *MobaXterm Home Edition*, which is free and does not need to be installed with an installer;
just download, unpack and execute.
If you want to use another terminal, key generator or data transfer app please consult their manuals...

#### 1.2 Launch MobaXterm key pair generator

 * 0: Check your MobaXterm version is **12.3 or newer** as older ones have a known bug and won't work.
 * 1: Launch MobaXterm and choose the ```MobaKeyGen (SSH key generator)``` from the tools as shown in the screenshot below.

#### 1.3 Configure key pair generator

![Select key type](img/MobaXterm2.png)

 * 2: From the **parameters** section at the bottom of the window choose: ```Type of key to generate:``` **ED25519**
 * 3: Click the **Generate** button...

#### 1.4 Generate key pair

![Generate randomness and subsequently key pair](img/MobaXterm3.png)

 * 4: Yes you really have to move the mouse now: computers are pretty bad at generating random numbers and MobaKeyGen uses the coordinates of your mouse movement as a seed to generate a random number.

#### 1.5 Secure private key and save pair to disk

Your key pair was generated.

Now make sure you:

 * 5:  Replace the comment in **Key comment** with  
       **your first initial followed by (optionally your middle name followed by) your family name** all in lowercase and without any separators like spaces, dots or underscores.  
       So if your name is _**Jack Peter Frank the Hippo**_, please use _**jthehippo**_ as comment, so we can easily identify the key as yours.
 * 6:  Secure your private key with a good password **before** saving the private key. DO NOT choose a simple password or even worse an empty one!
 * 7:  Confirm the password
 * 8:  Click the **Save public key** button.
 * 9:  Click the **Save private key** button.
 * 10: Select and copy all the text in the text box at the top of the window underneath **Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file**.
       You can paste it in the email you'll send in the next step.

## 2. Using Windows OpenSSH

Newer versions of Windows (10+) come with built-in OpenSSH software. The benefits of using this client software are

 - you don't need to install any additional software
 - it is open source implementation, following the OpenSSH code base that is used on Linux/Unix environments
 - (mostly) compatible with OpenSSH command options on Linux/Unix systems

The main disadvantages might be that is less user-friendly for less experienced users, as it does not offer any graphical interface. It only provides with command line interfaces.

### 2.1 Creating a keypair with OpenSSH

Start `PowerShell` or `cmd` (`Command prompt`) programs and run command `ssh-keygen`.
This will save private/public keypair into the `C:\Users\[Username]\.ssh` folder.
If you wish to create them at another another location, use

```
    C:\Users\[Username]\.ssh>ssh-keygen -f "C:\Users\[Username]\OneDrive - UMCG\Desktop\example_key"
    Generating public/private ed25519 key pair.
    Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
    Enter same passphrase again:
    Your identification has been saved in C:\Users\[Username]\OneDrive - UMCG\Desktop\example_key
    Your public key has been saved in C:\Users\[Username]\OneDrive - UMCG\Desktop\example_key
    The key fingerprint is:
    SHA256:JvnMkEf6lrP8x4LnzMIqi48/MRbd+gSz8ab+8mFwqQQ zkh\[Username]@ctxw11mup0108
    The key's randomart image is:
    +--[ED25519 256]--+
    |                 |
    |                 |
    |    E. ..        |
    |    ..==..       |
    |     .OBS        |
    |    +.o&+.       |
    |   . o.*@. .     |
    |   oo o+=*o o    |
    |  oo+=o====o     |
    +----[SHA256]-----+

    C:\Users\[Username]\.ssh>
```

then simply use the path and print the *public* key content

```
    C:\Users\[Username]\.ssh>type "C:\Users\[Username]\OneDrive - UMCG\Desktop\example_key"
    ssh-ed25519 AAAAC3NzaC1lZDI1NTE5AAAAILaeeGaCcRBjgwtOfQ6IKGs1GO8uT42tD3+4zZRKkMba example_key
    C:\Users\[Username]\.ssh>
```

you can copy-paste it in the email you'll send in the next step.

## 3. Request account and have the public key linked to your account

To request an account, [contact the helpdesk via email](../contact/) and
{% if 'nibbler' in slurm_cluster_name or 'talos' in slurm_cluster_name or 'vaxtron' in slurm_cluster_name %}
 * Make sure you have read the [Code of Conduct](../coc_umcg_research_clusters/) and tell us you agree with it using this email
{% endif %}
 * Paste the contents of the public key as displayed in MobaKeyGen's *Public key for pasting into OpenSSH authorized_keys file* field in the email.
 * Please motivate your account request and
     * For **guest** accounts to access only a data transfer machine associated with the cluster:
         * Specify the project your are working on and add your collaborators on CC.
     * For **regular** accounts to access the cluster **[request an account via email to helpdesk](request-an-account.md)**
 * Never ever email/give anyone your private key! If you do, the key is no longer *private* and useless for security: trash the key pair and start over by generating a new pair.
 * If you ever suspect that your private key may have been compromised (laptop got stolen, computer got infected with a virus/trojan/malware, etc.): 
    * [notify the helpdesk](../contact/) immediately, so we can revoke the public key for the compromised private key
    * and start over by generating a new pair.

## Start using servers/services

 * Once you get notified by email that your account is ready you can proceed to [login](../logins/)
 * If you want to request access to an additional group, send your request by email to the helpdesk and with the corresponding group owners on CC.
   You can lookup the group owners yourself on the cluster using:

             module load cluster-utils
             colleagues -g <groupname>
