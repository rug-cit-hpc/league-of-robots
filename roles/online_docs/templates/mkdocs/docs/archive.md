# Using remote archive storage

## 1. Overview

### 1.1. Basic overview

Remote archive is the storage, that is hosted on the tapes on the remote location.
Remote archive is connected to the UMCG research HPC clusters.
Currently, only [SURF archive](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/data-archive) is available as archive provider.

The following guidelines apply to this archive storage

- It is a remote storage to *write once* and *read rarely*.
- Performance accommodates occasional (once a year or less) access to the existing data on the remote tape storage.
- **Archive is not a backup**! It provides storage with lower costs than a normal disk storage.
- **Tape data does not have a backup**, so be extremely careful with the data deletion.
- If permissions and metadata of the files are needed to be kept, then they should be first packaged before uploading (use of `tar` or similar tool).
- File size must be considered - there should be **no small files** (see 'Best practices' below)
- Tape storage has the [ISO 27001 certification](https://www.surf.nl/en/services/data-archive)
- Data is stored in two physical locations in the Netherlands.

### 1.2. How it works

Archive is automatically mounted when user navigates to the `/groups/[GROUP]/arc[XX]` folder. At that moment storage from remote server gets mounted on the folder. It remains accessible until some specific idle time is reached.

Data-manager account of the specific group is the **only** account that has **read** and **write** access to the archive folder of the group. This is to prevent users accidentally recalling files online when not needed. Also to make sure that all the files are stored in correct format (see 'Best practices' below).

### 1.3 How can group request an access to the archive

In order for the groups to use SURF archive solution, they can either make a request to use a joint Shared Contract from the [Helpdesk](../contact) or they can choose to make their own Individual Contract with the SURF.

**Shared Contract**

Shared contract is a one-stop shop for the groups who want to avoid arranging their own SURF archive storage contract.
Groups that are using a Shared Contract, can access their SURF archive storage only within the UMCG HPC clusters maintained by the HPC [Helpdesk](../contact).
Data separation  between the groups is supported only within our HPC environments. And due to the fact that we cannot guarantee the separation outside of our systems, we do not provide the archive access for the groups outside our HPC environments. Groups that need this external access, should consider Individual Contract instead.

**Individual Contract**

Groups can arrange their own (separate) contract with SURF Archive, allowing unrestricted access to the archive storage from **any** external system. (As long as they use a protocol supported by the SURF archive server - SSH protocol.)
If a group wants its SURF Archive storage attached to the HPC system, the group owner must coordinate the request with (and provide the access to) the [Helpdesk](../contact).

## 2. Managing data

After some time, all the files on remote archive server get automatically migrated to the tape. The **metadata** and **tree structure** remain on remote disks, while the **data content** exist only on tape. When this happens, the metadata (like file names, permissions, timestamps, size, ownership, etc.) can be normally accessed and the structure can be normally browsed. `cd`, `ls` and `find` commands work just like they do on a *regular* filesystem.

The difference is that the file content is not directly available anymore until it is recalled. Any command that attempts to read the file content (like `less`, `cat` or `grep`) or to edit the content (like `vim` or `nano`) may **appear stuck**. Actually the machine is waiting for data to be retrieved, which can take a very long time since the data needs to be copied back from tape to disk.

Therefore the correct procedure is to **first stage (recall from the tape) the file, and access the content when it is available again**.

### 2.1. Data states

The data migrates on remote server from disk to tape and during this it has different states. **As long as the data is online (on disks), it is available to the user. It can be read or modified**.

| State | Code | Online (on disks) | Offline (on tape) | Explanation |
| ----- | ---- |-------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Regular | `REG` | Yes | No | Files are only on disk. File content can be accessed and changed. |
| Dual-state | `DUL` | Yes | Yes | Content is both on disk and on tape. |
| Offline | `OFL` | No | Yes | Content is no longer online/on disks, but only on tape. |
| Unmigrating | `QUE` | **No** | Yes | File queued for staging from tape. Not yet copied from tape. |
| Unmigrating | `STG` | **No**t yet / Partially | Yes | File being staged from tape to disk. Content is is unavailable until copy is finished. |

Note that the folders are always online (in state `REG`) and as such you can always
browse folders and check file permissions and their metadata information.

## 3. Workflow example

How to upload and modify states of the remote files.
Make sure your data/project/folder is accompanied by a README, see our [storage](../storage/#the-life-cycle-of-experimental-data) page, on how to write a good README.

**Main steps** to reliably upload the data

 - [prepare your environment](#prepare-your-environment)
 - [bundle the data](#bundling)
 - [create local checksum](#local-checksum)
 - [upload data to remote storage](#uploading)
 - [verify checksums on a remote storage](#remote-checksum)
 - [delete files on cluster](#delete-files-on-cluster)

### 3.1. Prepare your environment

**Become the data-manager user**

```
sudo -u [group]-dm bash
```

**(optional) Start screen session**

If you expect that the data preparation or upload will take a long time, you should consider using a `screen`.
It allows you to re-attach to a session after you lost the connection to the cluster.
See [1](https://manned.org/screen) and [2](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNU_Screen) for more information.

### 3.2. Bundling

Optional, but be aware that upload to an archive system should be in average well above 1GB per file.

**Checking**

We created a script that will help data managers to easily determine if the data is of correct size or too fragmented.
Simply run it and as an argument provide the path to the folder

`/usr/local/bin/arc_surf_sizecheck /path/to/data`

The script might take a little longer to finish if folder is larger or there are many small files.

When finished, it should print the information of the average filesize, and if the data can be
simply copied to the archive, or if not, it will suggest what to do next.


**Preparing the data**

Prepare the data by merging multiple files/folders
 into one compressed **tar.gz** file.

Here are two options available

a) data is compressed

the data can be bundled and *compressed* at the same time
```
   [dm-user@~]$ tar -czvf /groups/[group]/[prm0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz /groups/[group]/[prm0X]/projects/x/*
```
this will result (in comparison with the option b) in
 - taking longer to compress and decompress the files
 - smaller .tar.bz file - so less storage consumed on both prm and remote archive
 - taking less time to upload the file to the remote archive storage

b) or it can be simply bundled without compression
```
   [dm-user@~]$ tar -cvf /groups/[group]/[prm0X]/projects/project-x.tar /groups/[group]/[prm0X]/projects/x/*
```

this will result (in comparison to the option a)
 - in faster creation and possibly later extraction of the .tar file
 - but it will use more disk space both on prm and archive
 - and it will take longer to copy the entire file to the archive and back

---

### 3.3. Local checksum

Create a checksum of the file. This _fingerprint_ can
be checked later to verify that the file was successfully uploaded to the archive and that it was correctly restored when when downloading it back from the archive.
```
   [dm-user@~]$ sha256sum /groups/[group]/[prm0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz > /groups/[group]/[prm0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz.sha256sum
```

Checksum verification process on the remote storage side supports only **`sha256sum`**

---

### 3.4. Uploading

This step takes a long time, and if you disconnect from a cluster, the upload will be canceled and you will need to start it again.

This can be easily prevented by using the `screen` command ([man pages](https://manned.org/man/screen), [quick guide](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/GNU_Screen)) and running the copy from within it.
If the connection is lost, `screen` will continue running and finish the upload.

You can upload the file(s) to the archive either by using the `rsync` command ([man pages](https://manned.org/man/rsync)),
as it can show the upload progress

```
   dm-user $ rsync -rlP --progress /groups/[group]/[prm0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz /groups/[group]/arc[0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz
```

where the arguments are

 - `-r` is for recursive copy
 - `-l` preserves links
 - `-P` enables a partial copy, which means that a failed copy will not delete a partially created file, but will keep a file with partially uploaded content that can be resumed afterwards

Alternatively you can simply use `cp` command

```
    [dm-user@~]$ cp /groups/[group]/[prm0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz /groups/[group]/arc[0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz
```

---

### 3.5. Remote checksum

If file was copied recently, it _can be_ still on regular disks
on the remote archive server, so we can simply issue remote command to calculate the
`sha256sum` value of it
```
   /usr/local/bin/arc_surf --sha256sum /groups/[GROUP]/arcXX/subfolder/file
```

If checkum was also made just after the .tar(.gz) file was created, then both values can be checked if they are still identical.

### 3.6. Delete files on cluster

Files in tmp/prm that have been successfully archived and verified by checksum can be safely removed from the cluster.

### 3.7 Changing file state on the archive

**Move from disk to tape**

(optionally) If file is still online, it can be moved to the tape (or simply wait for it to automatically move there)

```
   [dm-user@~]$ /usr/local/bin/arc_surf --darelease /groups/[group]/arc[0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz
   Submitted to remote host, waiting for reply ...
   ( You can press CTRL+C and check later for the output in /var/cache/arcq//output/tmp.5eHsc2kAPj )
```

**Status**

Listing the file status

```
   [dm-user@~]$ /usr/local/bin/arc_surf --dals /groups/[group]/arc[0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz
   Submitted to remote host, waiting for reply ...
   ( You can press CTRL+C and check later for the output in /var/cache/arcq//output/tmp.ECc4X0dAEz )
   -rw-r-----  1 dm-user    dm-user    10485760000 2024-11-26 18:08 (OFL) project-x.tar.gz
```

**Move from tape to disks**

If file is offline, we can call it back to disks - stage it `online` with
```
   [dm-user@~]$ /usr/local/bin/arc_surf --daget /groups/[group]/arc[0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz
   Submitted to remote host, waiting for reply ...
   ( You can press CTRL+C and check later for the output in /var/cache/arcq//output/tmp.EeHDV2kAPj )
```

**Note**: when you request a file to be staged, for some time it will remain `OFL`, until it starts to be copied from tape to disks.

After some time we check the status again.

```
   [dm-user@~]$ /usr/local/bin/arc_surf --dals /groups/[group]/arc[0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz
   Submitted to remote host, waiting for reply ...
   ( You can press CTRL+C and check later for the output in /var/cache/arcq//output/tmp.qo7tO9CtVB )
   -rw-r-----  1 dm-user    dm-user    10485760000 2024-11-26 18:08 (QUE) project-x.tar.gz
```

In this example, the file has status `QUE` (queued), but it can also have `STG` (staged).
We must wait until it is changed to `DUL` (Dual-state).

### 3.8 Retrieving the data from archive and extracting it

Make sure the .tar.gz file

```
    [dm-user@~]$ rsync --progress /groups/[group]/arc[0X]/projects/project-x.tar.gz /groups/[group]/tmp[0X]/projects/
    [dm-user@~]$ cd /groups/[group]/tmp[0X]/projects/
    [dm-user@~]$ tar -xvzf project-x.tar.gz
```

## 4. Other command line options

Use `--help` argument to get more information

```
   [dm-user@~]$ /usr/local/bin/arc_surf --help
   Provide one of the following arguments
    --quiet                  don't print the start message - supress the extra output
    --budget                 print the used disk space by my group
                             (note that the second number might include space from other groups as well)
    --dafind-reg <path>      search for regular / online files (present only on disk)
                             (there is no copy on tape) Directories are always REG.
    --dafind-dul <path>      search for files that reside both online (on disk) and offline (on tape)
    --dafind-ofl <path>      search for files that are offline (present only on tape)
    --dafind-que <path>      search for files that are queued for copy FROM TAPE to disk
                             (are not yet copying, data is also not yet available). This is state before STG.
    --dafind-stg <path>      search for files which are currently being copied FROM TAPE to disk
                             (files that are currently copying, but data is not yet available)
    --daget      <path>      recall / request data to be staged online FROM TAPE to disk
    --dals       <path>      list file state in long format (including queue state)
    --darelease  <path>      send to offline / stage TO TAPE
    --sha256sum  <path>      compute the sha256sum of the file
```

## 5. Best practices

It is always highly recommended to accompany files with their checksums, especially when utilizing remote archive storage. Long-term storage can occasionally experience data degradation or loss, therefore verifying the file's checksum upon retrieval is the most reliable way to ensure the data remains intact and uncorrupted.
Make sure your data/project/folder is accompanied by a README, see our [storage](../storage/#the-life-cycle-of-experimental-data) page, on how to write a good README.

File sizes are extremely important for archive. Tape storage performance and management is better when the files are larger size.

Therefore

 - files should be in range 1 and 100GB (checksums are exception)
 - average file size should not be lower than a **1GB**
 - the archive filesystem was build around the idea of occasional (as in *once or twice a year at most*) accessing the data content

The average size is monitored and the groups with average size lower than this will have **locked accounts**.

To keep storage and network load manageable, upload data sequentially rather than in parallel. Note that archive is a _remote_, _shared_ storage system used by multiple teams. As such, it has less bandwidth compared to the other cluster storage systems.


## 6. Performance

The speed of upload and download depends on the following conditions

 - the total bandwidth usage of the network by all the users on the Login node
 - (for restoring the data) the usage of the prm/tmp disk utilization by all users
 - load of the data and network on the remote tape archive system that hosts the data

So far the tests have shown the upload speeds in between of 30 and 50 MB/s.
Which means that archiving and restoring of the large datasets can take (depending on the size) anywhere from several hours to several days.

## 7. Issues

So far most of the bugs have been resolved, but it could happen that

 - the archive folder is not available - please inform the [helpdesk](../contact) unless maintenance was announced,
 - download/upload perfomance occasionally drops - this most probably depends on the Login node usage (and data copy by other users) - notify helpdesk if it persists for a longer period,

If you expirence any issues with the archive solution, please notify the helpdesk.

```
Where is my data stored?

The Data Archive maintains two tape libraries for security and redundancy in two physically separate locations in the Amsterdam and Haarlemmermeer municipalities.  When data is uploaded to the Data Archive using SSH, (HPN)SCP, SFTP, rsync, GridFTP, iRODS, etc. it ends up on an online disk space managed by the Data Migration Facility (DMF). The DMF will then manage the careful migration of files from the disk space to two tape libraries until your data is available on both tape libraries. Once your data is safely stored in the two tape libraries it may be removed from the disk space (aka offline). Offline data can be interacted with in the same manner as online data though users may notice a delay in access time.
