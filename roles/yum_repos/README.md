# yum_repos: Manage yum/dnf repos.

This role can be used to manage all `yum` / `dnf` repos on machines,
which need to be linked to official/public repos directly.

Do **not** use this role to link a machine to self-hosted snapshots of repos
or systems like _Pulp_, which can be used to _freeze_ repos.
For _Pulp_ see the `pulp_client` role instead.

To make a repository locally (on the machine itself) check `yum_local` role instead.

This role will manage all `yum` / `dnf` repos on hosts; This means:
 * Apply configs and GPG key files for repos whose repo ID is listed in the `yum_repos_deployed_on_clients` variable for a machine.  
   See ```group_vars/all/vars.yml``` for defaults.
 * The repo ID listed in `yum_repos_deployed_on_clients` is used to lookup the config for the repo listed in the `yum_repos` variable.  
   See ```group_vars/all/vars.yml``` for defaults.  
   This allows setting `yum_repos_deployed_on_clients` to a subset of all repos from `yum_repos` for specific machines.
 * Unspecified options for repos listed in the `yum_repos_deployed_on_clients` variable will be left untouched.
 * **Delete** the `/etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo` repo config file on a machine,
   when not a single repo listed in that file is listed in the `yum_repos_deployed_on_clients` variable.
   (Except for repos in the `local_yum.repo` file, which may be created by the `yum_local` role and which is skipped by this role.)
 * Repos will remain untouched/preserved "as is", when at least one other repo listed in the same `*.repo` config file
   is listed in `yum_repos_deployed_on_clients` and therefore managed by this role.

Note:
* We do NOT use `ansible.builtin.yum_repository` any longer as there is no `ansible.builtin.dnf_repository` equivalent for newer distros.
* We do NOT install the _EPEL_ repo using the `epel-release` RPM with `ansible.builtin.package`,
  because on RedHat >= 8.x it will install `*.repo` files with broken links and broken paths to GPG key files.

#### Example code snippets for the `yum_repos_deployed_on_clients` and `yum_repos` variables:

In the example below
* The dict key `rocky9` must match the value of `os_distribution` in `group_vars/{{ stack_name }}/vars.yml`.  
  E.g. `os_distribution: 'rocky9'`
* The `baseos*` repos are examples of repos for which many settings are taken/used "as is" and left untouched.  
  This allows to OS the provide updates for the `baseurl`, `metalink` or `mirrorlist` options.
* The `epel*` repos are examples of repos for which everything is configured
  and for which the GPG key file will be downloaded from `gpgkeysource` and imported with `ansible.builtin.rpm_key`.
